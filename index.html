    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Quality Neighborhood Properties, LLC is a veteran owned, family business serving the Greater Houston area in
      Texas. We are a real estate investing and consulting company. Have you been told you need to make repairs before
      you can list your property through a realtor? Are you out of time and need to close in a hurry?
      Do you live out of the area and just need someone to take care of everything?
      Are you tired of the landlord headaches?
      Do you dread the thought of showings and open houses and haggling offers?
      We can help with these situations and more! Once you contact us, we will work with you to determine what options
      you have and if your house matches our criteria. We will always be open and transparent so that you are informed
      at all times and we will not surprise you with last minute re-negotiations like some of those national chains you
      may have heard about. Plus we don't litter your neighborhood with all those "We Buy Houses" signs.
      There is no risk, commitment, or obligation to get a quote. Contact us today and learn more.
